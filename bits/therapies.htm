          where reflex points on the foot correspond
          to different parts of the body. In a similar
          way to Acupuncture, Reflexology is able to
          unblock energy pathways creating good health
          and balance throughout the systems of the
          body.<br><br>Reflexology creates a deep relaxation on
          all levels of your being allowing you to
          relax and release the stresses and strains
          of daily life. Many clients have likened
          the experience to the opiate type drugs that
          are given in hospital for pain relief, when
          you feel a little drowsy and relaxed. It
          is at this level of deep relaxation that
          the body is able to heal itself, both physically
          and emotionally, and the mind is able to
          really switch off. It is an extremely tranquil
          experience.<br><br>The practice of working feet for health has
          been around for thousands of years and each
          of the ancient civilisations had their own
          adaptation of it. The mother of modern Reflexology
          was a Physiotherapist called Eunice Ingham
          in the 1930&#39;s. Today it is one of the
          most widely used and enjoyed therapies around
          and research has found it to be useful for
          many conditions including Pregnancy, Labour
          and Cancer care.<br>&nbsp;<br><br><font size="2"><b>Precision</b></font> <b>Reflexology</b><br>Precision Reflexology is a very gentle treatment
          that works on the flow of energy through
          the body. Reflex points are worked energetically
          using very light pressure and different reflexes
          are linked creating subtle but powerful results.
          This treatment is excellent for both chronic
          and acute conditions as well as for those
          who are very sensitive to their environment.<br><br><br><br></div><div style="text-align: center; margin: 4px;"><img alt=" " border="0" src="../images/branch.jpg" title=" "></div><div><b>Maternity Reflexology</b><br>This is reflexology specific to the ailments
          and conditions that may be experienced during
          pregnancy. It is most often used as a preventative
          measure and at the first sign of some conditions
          such as oedema. Studies have also shown that
          regular treatments can shorten labour time
          and reduce or eliminate the need for pain
          medication. I have trained in maternity reflexology
          with Moshe Kruchik, an internationally recognised
          specialist in the field. A must for all expectant
          mothers.<br><br><b>Post-natal Reflexology</b><br>Often referred to as the fourth trimester,
          the time after the placenta has been delivered
          is an important time for mothers. A time
          of great change both in her life and in her
          body. Reflexology can help to rebalance and
          re-energise the body after pregnancy. Deep
          relaxation is given to promote healing throughout
          all the body systems.<br><br><br><b>Baby Reflexology</b><br>Birth, whichever the delivery method, is
          a time of trauma for newborn babies. From
          the warm, secure and enveloped safety of
          their mothers they are forced into a hostile
          environment where they must learn the very
          basics of life, breathing &amp; eating, anew.
          Reflexology can help babies to overcome the
          trauma of birth and the stresses of adapting
          to their new world. <br>In my experience children respond well to
          reflexology and find a wonderful peace and
          stillness within themselves when having a
          treatment.<br>I am able to offer treatments to your baby
          in hospital should you wish it.<br><br><b>Fertility</b><br>Conception is a time of great joy but for
          some couples it is much harder to achieve
          than for others. There are lots of reasons
          for this - PCOS, low sperm count/quality,
          PMS, hormonal imbalances, Endometriosis,
          Varicocele to name but a few. Reflexology
          doesn&#39;t claim to be able to do what many
          other doctors, consultants or therapists
          have tried but it can offer you something.
          Through regular Reflexology treatments it
          is possible to prepare your body for conception
          by creating relaxation from the stresses
          involved in the process. It can also help
          you to become aware of your body and when
          you are likely to conceive.<br><br>Contact me for more information regarding

          ranging, from the basic fundamental principles
          of touch, the manipulation and release of
          muscle tension to the alleviation of soft
          tissue injury.<br><br>Drawing upon my years of experience and a

          strokes of an Aromatherapy treatment I can
          tailor your treatment to suit your requirements

          heated basalt stones interspersed with cold
          stones to stimulate the blood supply to the
          skin and muscles. Placements can be used
          to create localised deep heat penetration
          direct to the large muscles of the back and
          to the neck, where stress is often held.
          This allows for a deeper muscular release
          but also creates a feeling of luxurious warmth
          and comfort. One stroke of a heated basalt
          stone is considered to be the equivalent
          of five strokes of the therapists hand, releasing
          stress and muscular tension. Pure bliss.<br><br>Alternatively, Hot &amp; Cold Stones can
          be used therapeutically to relieve acute
          muscular conditions, deep seated tension
          or to help heal injuries as part of a bespoke
          treatment specific to you and your needs.<br><br><br><br><br><br></div><div><b>Aromatherapy</b><br>Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils
          to promote health. The essential oil is the
          essence of a plant extracted, usually, through
          distillation. There are many beneficial plants
          that have extremely therapeutic oils within
          them and can offer a very wide range of health
          benefits to us.<br>Oils are chosen for their therapeutic qualities
          and the aroma the client is drawn to. They
          are then mixed into a blend using a base
          oil, Cold Pressed Sunflower Oil due to it&#39;s
          light, easily absorbable quality and non
          greasy texture. <br>An aromatherapy massage is a slow relaxing
          treatment that works on helping the body
          absorb the essential oils into the skin.<br>Creams can also be made to use as part of
          your daily skin regime, all designed to suit
          your personal needs.<br><br><br><br></div><div style="text-align: center; margin: 4px;"><img alt=" " border="0" src="../images/branch.jpg" title=" "></div><div><b>Facial Rejuvenation Massage</b><br>From the Ayurvedic tradition, a luxurious,

          muscles and allowing an increase in the life
          nourishing blood to enter the tissue, in

          of muscular tension and increased blood supply
          serve to eliminate the build up of toxins
          through the Lymphatic System resulting in
          a fuller, fresher, pinker skin tone. This

          that have been soaked in honey and herbs
          giving them a waxy feel and a therapeutic
          aroma. It is recommended that only Biosun

          The process is repeated on the other ear
