I have been a qualified Complementary Therapist
          for many years. During that time I have successfully
          worked with a wide range of people and conditions
          and feel privileged to have been able to
          help so many people within my community.<br><br>Working on my own children made me realise
          that my interest lay in working with families.
          I have developed my skills and qualifications
          to specialise in the area of Fertility, Maternity,
          Babies and children. I am passionate about
          my work and my clients.<br><br>I live in the South West in Devon and my
          clinic is based at the <a href="http://www.enhc.org/">Exeter Natural Health Centre</a> in Queens Walk - between Queen Street and
          Gandy Street - a tranquil haven right in
          the heart of the city. The Centre offers
          a relaxing area, with refreshments, where
          you can sit quietly after your treatment
          before returning to the hustle and bustle
          of life.<br><br><br></div><div>
