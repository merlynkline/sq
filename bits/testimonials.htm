<div>My work has given me the opportunity to help
          many people over the last few years. My clients
          are of all ages and backgrounds and they
          come to me for many different reasons. Some
          need just one treatment while others have
          several or see me regularly over a longer
          period. Here are some things they have had
          to say about their experiences:<br><br></div><div><b>Zoe, Maternity Reflexology 2009</b><br>
           <div>I started having weekly sessions of reflexology
           when I was 32 weeks pregnant with my 3rd
           son.&nbsp; My pregnancy&nbsp;was uncomplicated
           apart from some hip discomfort, and a few
           digestive niggles.&nbsp; The reflexology
           certainly helped with both these problems,
           and most importantly helped me to relax and
           sleep well.&nbsp; The nights after the sessions
           I almost always slept&nbsp;very deeply.</div>
           <div>&nbsp;</div>
           <div>Neither of my previous births had been complicated,
           nor overly long (the first was 10 hours,
           the second 6 hours).&nbsp; However I really
           believe that the reflexology played an important
           part in making my third labour as easy, relatively
           pain free and quick as it was.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
           was 7cms dilated when I arrived at the hospital
           much to my midwife&#39;s shock.&nbsp; My
           contractions had been fairly light and uneven,
           with the odd strong one every now and then.&nbsp;
           My son, George, was born 3 hours later.&nbsp;
           I had no&nbsp;tearing or even much bruising,
           in fact I didn&#39;t really feel like I&nbsp;had
           given birth at all!</div>
           <div>&nbsp;</div>
           <div>I also believe the reflexology helped my
           son get into the correct position, he&nbsp;had
           been&nbsp;back to back&nbsp;at the last 2&nbsp;midwife
           appointments.&nbsp; After both Sue used part
           of the sessions I had to persuade him to
           move, and he did,&nbsp;again making the labour
           much easier.</div>
           <div>&nbsp;</div>
           <div>Another thing&nbsp;that was rather wonderful
           about the reflexology was feeling my baby
           respond to&nbsp;some of the manipulations.&nbsp;
           It gave me a real feeling of connection,
           and made me realise how &quot;in touch&quot;
           my whole body was with the baby inside me.</div>
           <div>&nbsp;</div>
           <div>If I decide to have any more children I would
           absolutely want to have reflexology throughout
           the pregnancy again.</div><br></div><div><b>Emma, Maternity Reflexology 2009/10</b><br> I have had reflexology during two pregnancies
          and found it hugely helpful. It has relieved
          constipation and back ache and left me feeling
          energised. It seems to have a direct effect
          on the baby too, who moves around a lot more
          than normal for a few hours after each treatment.<br><br></div><div><b>Kate, Reflexology</b> <b>2009/10</b><br>A session with Susan Quayle is a pleasure,
          in every sense of the word: her enthusiasm
          for both her treatments and you as a patient
          is infectious. I always look forward to a
          treatment and, although she has worked her
          magic and cured my illness, I still love
          going back time and again because a session
          with Susan goes so far beyond addressing
          the immediate need - it restores balance
          to every other aspect of your being.<br><br>I had suffered with a chronic undiagnosed
          abdominal condition for nearly six years
          when I first contacted Susan for Reflexology.
          Prior to my first session, she had conducted
          copious amounts of research on my symptoms
          and showed real optimism and a genuine willingness
          to help. Susan advised an intensive period
          of weekly sessions but, as soon as my condition
          started to alleviate, Susan herself suggested
          a reduction in sessions, and has remained
          conscientious and understanding throughout
          the seven months we have been meeting.<br><br>I cannot praise Susan Quayle enough: as both
          a professional and a friend. <br><br></div><div><b>TR, a female client</b><br>In August 2008 my Father suddenly passed
          away. This sent my world into a complete
          spin. So much to do, so much to organize,
          caring for loved ones and on top of all this
          coping with the emotional and physical pain
          that comes with grieving for someone you
          love so dearly.<br><br>I put all of what I was feeling to one side
          and got back into the swing of home life
          with my own family and work. A friend gave
          me a voucher to have a body massage with
          Susan. I arranged for this to be at my own
          house, I felt that this would be better for
          me as I could then relax after and not have
          to drive home. The massage was quite intense.
          Susan recognized that I had that I had become
          quite &lsquo;knotted&rsquo; and tense and
          this would take a lot of manipulation. Several
          bruises appeared after the session - however
          Susan had warned me that with such an intense
          massage this would probably&nbsp; happen.<br><br>The feelings that I experienced following
          the treatment were quite powerful, they ranged
          from feeling tired to gaining energy. I wanted
          to drink a lot of water and subsequently
          needed to wee a lot!&nbsp; A few days following
          treatment the tears flowed and flowed &ndash;
          but in a good way that gave me a feeling
          of relief and that a <b>heavy weight had been lifted from me</b>. One of the most powerful feelings I felt/feel,
          was that I was no longer weighed down with
          grief, yes you still feel emotional and the
          tears are never far away but, being able
          to relax into one&#39;s feelings instead
          of fighting them and becoming tense, is I
          feel, down to having massage. I wouldn&rsquo;t
          hesitate to recommend massage as it has helped
          me both physically and emotionally during
          a time where your whole body is tested to
          its limits.<br><br></div>
